# SyriaTel-Churn-Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to use various methods and models of machine learning to develop a framework for SyriaTel to optimize customer retention by minimizing churn.

Initially the data, made available by SyriaTel was cleaned, preprocessed and fed into various models to establish the most efficient and effective predictor of churn.
Conclusions were drawn from these results and recommendations were given that would hopefully aid in maximizing customer retention

 First the percentage of churners vs non-churners was visualized

Then churn was visualized against other metric

Then the correlation between churn and other factos was observed.

The data waas then fed into multiple models before landing on the KNearest Neighbor model as the best performing one
